# Dotfiles

**In short**

* All dotfiles are managed with [YADM](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm)
* ZSH configuration is managed by [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody). Configuration file for [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) experiment is available, but not used.
* ZSH in short is [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k) for segments, a minimal import of [oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh], and lots of [plugins](.zsh_plugins.txt)
* VIM on desktop is [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/), a small and fast `.vimrc` is provided for server setups.
* All software is managed by [brew](https://brew.sh/) and [brew cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask). New environments are set up with [brew bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle)
* GPG setup is a consolidation of the man page and various sources, but particular [riseup](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices)'s guide was influential
